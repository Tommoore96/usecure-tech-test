## uSecure Technical Test
This is Tom Moore's tech test, please contact me if you've got any questions.
### Start up
`bun run dev`

### Tech choices
Besides React and Typescript, I've not really used any of these technologies in a professional capacity before, but a tech stack of NextJS and Redux seemed like overkill to me.  Especially when SEO isn't important an SPA seems much more appropriate so I chose:
- Vite - As this app is only small, doesn't require SEO or server side logic a lightweight SPA server is the better choice.  Also, I know you use Vite, as well as Tan Router, which cannot be used with Vite.
- Tan Router - I've not used this before, it's only recently become production ready and on a project this size and for what I needed it for it probably doesn't make much difference over the traditional React Router.  But, I know it's what uSecure use, I trust the TanStack and it's another thing to learn so why not.
- TypeScript - I cannot not use TypeScript anymore.  Main reason is it saves time by catching bugs early.
- Tailwind - I know it's quick to build, run, and easily customisable.
